# Configuration for the MimicEnv RL Environment

# Telemetry signals to use for the observation (error) vector.
# These must match the sensor names in TelemetryStreamer.
# NOTE: 'slipAngle' is a custom sensor we'll need to define.

  - 'g-force-lateral'
  - 'g-force-longitudinal'
  - 'yaw_rate'
  - 'roll_rate'

# Action space definition.
# Each action will be scaled from [-1, 1] to these physical ranges.

  # Penalties
  action_smoothness_penalty: 0.05 # Penalizes large changes in action between steps
  action_magnitude_penalty: 0.01  # Penalizes large action values overall

# Episode termination conditions
max_steps_per_episode: 2000 # Max length of a training trajectory
damage_threshold: 1000      # Terminate if vehicle damage exceeds this value
